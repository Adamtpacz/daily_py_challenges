# SEI Daily ~~Code~~ Python Challenges  üêç üêç üêç

## Instructions
- Fork and clone this repo.

- All challenges have invoked their function, and printed their solution to the console. To test your code run **python3 challenge.py** and check the result in console for the given challenge.

- Each code challenge (excluding the two **special** challenges 29-30) requires writing a **single function** to solve.

- Be sure to remove the **pass** statement before testing your code.

- After solving a challenge, be sure to check the solution(s) contained in `solutions.py`. If multiple solutions are provided, they are typically shown in increasing order of "elegance".

## Committing and Pushing your Work

- Your instructors will be checking your progress from time-to-time. As you solve the challenges, commit your work, and `$ git push origin main`. This pushes the updates to your fork.
